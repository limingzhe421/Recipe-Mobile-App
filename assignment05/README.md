# DH110 Assignment 6: Low Fidelity Prototype

## Mingzhe Li (Vera)

### Project description


According to my user research, the user personas that i have identified are people who are responsible for cooking their own meals and people who are responsible for cooking for others. They have the desire to cook but have limited knowledge of certain recipes. They are willing to try new recipes online. 

The features I included for people to use are searching up new recipes, signing up for the email list on recipe websites and listening to recipe instructions online. People can search up recipes by typing in the food category or certain name of the dish and clicking the search bar. They can also sign up for the email list by entering their email and click "Join us!". Last by not least, they can also listen to the instruction for certain recipes if they do not want to reach the webpage and stop the reading if they want. 

The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is to test whether the features that I want to include on the website are helpful for the users.
