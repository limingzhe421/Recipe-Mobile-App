# DH110 Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype

## Mingzhe Li (Vera)

### Project description


According to my user research, the user personas that I have identified are people who are responsible for cooking their own meals and people who are responsible for cooking for others. They have the desire to cook but have limited knowledge of certain recipes. They are willing to try new recipes online. 

The features I included for people to use are searching up new recipes, signing up for the email list on recipe websites and listening to recipe instructions online. People can search up recipes by typing in the food category or certain names of the dish and clicking the search bar. They can also sign up for the email list by entering their email and click "Join us!". Last by not least, they can also listen to the instruction for certain recipes if they do not want to reach the webpage and stop the reading if they want. 

The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is to test whether the features that I want to include on the website are helpful for the users.

### Reflection

To prepare for a low-fidelity prototype, I learned that I need to draw clear wireframes and make the wireflow as easy as possible in order for users to follow my design. I also need to give clear instructions for the tester in order to test for the prototype. 

Overall, the testing went pretty smoothly. The tester was able to follow my instruction well and complete each step quickly. It also appears to her that my design was pretty simple and clear. She did not think of anything to improve on for my design. She did not make any mistakes when completing the steps nor did she encounter any confusion. Even though she suggested to me that my design was pretty good and there is nothing I should improve on, on my end, to make my design better, I think I would make certain icons bigger in order for the users to find those icons even more easily.
