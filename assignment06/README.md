# Interactive Prototype

## Mingzhe Li (Vera)

### Description of project 

This is a high-fidelity prototype of a recipe application. The prototype is created by Figma. The purpose of the testing is to examine the functions of two features designed based on the persona, Rachel Bae and Charlie Stewart. This high-fidelity prototype is transformed from the low-fidelity hand-drawn prototype with improved graphic elements, UI material components, and features.

The process takes place in terms of two full sequences of activities users can perform on the the application. First, when user wants to browse the recipes and check out certain recipes that they are interested in, they can click the categories icon on the top of the home page. For example, the use clicks the appetizer icon and it will direct the user to the appetizers section. If the user is interested in the special recipe, they will click on the icon and it will direct them to the detailed recipe page. If the user prefers to listen to the recipe instead of reading the text, like our persona Charlie  Stewart, they can simply click the text to audio icon to hear the recipe instead of reading it. Secondly, when the user goes to their profile, they can join the email listand receive new recipes. This will be helpful for people like our persona Rachel Bae who always wants to explore new recipes and stay up to date. 

### Screen design

My screen design is shown below.

As shown below, I have created design variations with different color schemes including light-mode, dark-mode and hue variations. For the two hue variations, I put the subtle pattern on the main background for one design and the subtle pattern on the menu bar at the bottom for another design.

### Accessibility (color-contrast) check

As shown in the picture below, my design passes the color check for all color variations.

### Design System

For typography, I used Palatino, which is is the name of an old-style serif typeface. I mainly used size 14 and Bold to keep the font consistent. I used some variation of the fonts throughout my app design. While keeping the font as Palatino for all the pages, I made some title size 20 to highlight the information and make the design more dynamic. I also used regular instead of bold for some detailed information such as recipe steps and ingredients to differentiate the level of information presented on the page. 

For color scheme, I was trying to go for a general warm tone so I choose the light orange color (HEX:FAC564) as my main color. I used the light orange color mainly for my menu bar, buttons and as highlight stroke for my images. I kept the background as white color to maintain a clean and neat interface design. I used black color for my texts to make it readable from the white and yellow background.
