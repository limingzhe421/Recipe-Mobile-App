### Introduction

The Recipe Critic website provides thousands of recipes for food and desserts. According to my heuristics evaluation, 

We will be performing a usability test for The Recipe Critic. A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a user’s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site. 

Introduction with the name of the web/app you test and what the web/app is about. 
Report the rationale behind of UT with the list of the usability issues you found from your heuristic reviews
Indicate that the purpose of the usability testing aims to find out how to improve the web/app from the user's perspective.
Describe the setting(where, portable minimalistic lab), equipment(computer, software)
Report that it is a pilot test (in order to test the setting and the materials).
Describe the process (ex. Background questions, pretest, posttest) and what was measured (ex. Ease of use)



Two laptops using Morae software captured the participant’s face, comments, navigation choices and the data logger’s notes. The test administrator and data logger were present in the testing room. The session captured each participant’s navigational choices, task completion rates, comments, overall satisfaction ratings, questions and feedback.
