# DH110 assignment02 Usability Testing

### Introduction

The Recipe Critic website provides thousands of recipes for food and desserts. According to my heuristics evaluation, the main user experience issues I found were visibility of system status and aesthetic and minimalist design. To elaborate, since this is a website to teach people how to make pizza, users would want to see a recipe when they open this website. However, the website is at the bottom of the page. Users have to scroll down a lot to find the recipe. There is a "jump to recipe" button but it is almost too small for anyone to notice. Moreover, the design of the website is very messy. The information is scattered all over the website. The fonts vary too much, making the website less neat and professional.

Given these concerns, I will be performing a usability test for The Recipe Critic. A usability test is intended to determine the extent to an interface facilitates a user’s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the website. I have created three tasks to test whether the participant's user experience reflects the issues I discovered in my heuristics evaluation. The purpose of the usability testing aims to find out how to improve the website from the user's perspective.


**The setting and equipment used for the usability testing was as follow:**

•	This test is conducted at the participant's home. A camera was used to capture the participant’s face, comments, navigation choices and the data logger’s notes. The test administrator and data logger were present in the testing room. The session captured each participant’s navigational choices, task completion rates, comments, overall satisfaction ratings, questions and feedback. 


This is a pilot test in order to test the settings and materials. 


**The process of the usability test was as follows:**

•	Intro

•	Background questions

•	Previous experience questions

•	Pre-test questions

•	Three Tasks

•	Post-test questions

•	SUS questionnaire

•	Product satisfaction card

•	Demographics


**What was measured in this usability test:**

•	Ease of use

•	Frequency of use

•	Difficulty to keep track of location in the website

•	Learnability  - how easy it would be for most users to learn to use the website

•	Information facilitation – how quickly participant could find information

•	Look & feel appeal – homepage’s content makes me want to explore the site further

•	Site content – site’s content would keep me coming back 

•	Site organization

### Summary

**What I learned from this pilot test:**

I learned that usability issues do exist for this website. For example, my participant thought that there was too much inconsistency in this website and she described the website as busy. This shows that the website does not reflect the aesthetic and minimalist design. It also took my participant longer than expected to find the recipe and print it out, showing there is a lack of visibility of system status. These issues should be fixed in order to provide a better user experience for this website. 


**What went smoothly:**
The participant understood the instructions pretty well. She talked aloud a lot of her thoughts when she was understanding the questions and following along the instructions. I was able to clarify the questions for her when she was unsure of some of them. Overall, the testing process went smoothly and we were able to finish testing without interruption. 


**What I would do differently:**
There was one part of the testing where she misunderstood my instruction and searched the wrong word. I thought it might be because I was reading the instruction too fast. To prevent this from happening, I would read the instructions slower and more clearly and emphasize the keywords when I do similar testing in the future.
