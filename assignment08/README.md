# Michelin at home: Make cooking fun and engaging for all 

## Vera Li


### Introduction

This project is about designing an application that makes it easier for people to cook at home. This application includes video tutorials, audio tutorials and recipe communities for all people to join. Due to COVID-19, the need for home-cooking increased tremendously. It is important to provide more accessible recipe websites for people to cook at home, including senior citizens. With the increasing use of technology among young people, an increasing number of applications have been designed to cater to them. The need for the elderly to use online applications is often overlooked. Thus, I would like to design an application that is not only popular among young people, but can also cater to the needs of senior citizens as well. This application is especially elderly-friendly. With features such as “text to audio” and easily adjustable font size on the app, the elderly can navigate to their favorite recipe and learn to cook easily. 


### Design statement

Through my UX design project, I hope to impact the lives of senior citizens and others by offering an easy and seamless way to find recipes online that they would like to try and help them stay up-to-date to their favorite kinds of food by offering them to join various recipe communities to stay connected. 


### Competitor analysis

To get a sense of how other websites and applications were presenting information on food and recipe, I conducted heuristic evaluations on two websites: The National Council on Aging and the Recipe Critic website. I chose to analyze these two sites because they represented two important features about the application that I intend to design -- senior citizens and recipes. By evaluating them against the 10 heuristic, I am more informed about how these websites choose to present information to account for user experience.

I conducted usability testing about the Recipe Critic website to determine the extent to which an interface facilitates a user’s ability to complete routine tasks. The purpose of the usability testing aims to find out how to improve the website from the user's perspective. I learned that usability issues do exist for this website. For example, my participant thought that there was too much inconsistency in this website and she described the website as busy. This shows that the website does not reflect the aesthetic and minimalist design. It also took my participant longer than expected to find the recipe and print it out, showing there is a lack of visibility of system status. I learned to bear these issues in mind when designing my application to provide a better user experience for the users. [Read more...](https://github.com/limingzhe421/DH110/tree/main/assignment02)
