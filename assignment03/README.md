# Main design challenge 
**What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?**

The project will support people to find the recipe using easier and clearer methods.

**What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)**

This activity fulfills people's basic nutrition needs. People need to learn how to cook to provide themselves physical and mental satisfaction. 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

Currently, there are a lot of physical recipe books for people to follow. There are also many videos about recipes and texts about recipes on some websites. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**

Even though there are videos about recipes and texts about recipes on some websites, a lot of the websites do not include a simple video tutorial. By incorporating videos on certain recipe websites, it will be easier for users to search up recipes and learn about them with more visual help. 


# Target users 
**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**

The target users are people who are responsible for cooking their own meal and cook on a regular basis. 

**Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)**

Users can search up recipes on their phone or laptop to find the recipes that they are interested in and learn from them. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)**

To learn a recipe, users must search up the recipe online or find it from a recipe book. They are able to follow the recipe step by step. They could save it for future use. 


# Research methods 

To gain a better sense of how I could create a website that is useful to different types of users, I conducted contextual inquiry with participatory observations. 

The session consisted of the following sections:

1. Background questions 

I wanted to learn about how often does my participant cook and what she typically does when she needs to find a recipe. 

2. Observation 

I allowed the user to search up recipes using video tools and non-video tools respectively. 

3. Follow-up questions 

I wanted to gain some insight about how the users feel about the activity by asking her satisfaction and frustration about the activity.
