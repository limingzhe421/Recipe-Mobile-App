# The purpose of UX storytelling

The purpose of UX storytelling is to understand the users and connect with the users. It allows people to gain insights into the usersâ€™ thoughts, behaviors, actions, and contexts. By creating persona that represents potential users, the design team can know better about the uses' needs and provide better product for the users. 

# Key features I want to propose for the UX design
