# The purpose of UX storytelling

The purpose of UX storytelling is to understand the user; it allows design teams to gain insights into their usersâ€™ thoughts, behaviors, actions, and contexts. In addition to this, it allows team to connect quickly, to establish an agreed upon perception of their user, so that they may work effectively to design a cohesive product.
